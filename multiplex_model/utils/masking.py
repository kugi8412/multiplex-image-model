    This function performs two types of masking:
    1. Random channel subset selection (keeping min_channels_frac to 100% of channels) - optional
    2. Full channel masking (dropping up to fully_masked_channels_max_frac of remaining channels)

    Args:

        channel_ids (torch.Tensor): Channel IDs [B, C]

        fully_masked_channels_max_frac (float): Maximum fraction of channels to fully mask
        apply_channel_subset_sampling (bool): Whether to apply channel subset sampling before masking.
            Set to False for validation/testing to only do full channel masking.
